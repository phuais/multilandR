\title{Class 'MultiLandMetrics'}
\description{
Objects of class \code{MultiLandMetrics} are returned by \code{\link[=metrics]{metrics()}}. It holds all the information
relative to the metrics that were calculated by the parameters inputted by the user. This object
class can be passed to functions \code{\link[=pair_corr]{pair_corr()}}, \code{\link[=pair_plots]{pair_plots()}}, \code{\link[=landscape_filter]{landscape_filter()}}, \code{\link[=optimize_gradient]{optimize_gradient()}} and
\code{\link[=bind_metrics]{bind_metrics()}} for further analyses.
